Some things id like to add to this game are:
1. the ability to choose to have the deck cut or not
5. split pairs, players cards are divided and played individually, 1x payout for blackjack
6. doubling down when first two cards equal 9 10 or 11, one more card is dealt face down and settled at end of round
7.

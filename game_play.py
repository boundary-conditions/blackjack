Some things id like to add to this game are:
*Betting system needed*
1. the ability to choose to have the deck cut or not
2. opening bets, natural blackjack notice on first add_hand, 1.5 payout
3. hit players one at a time until stand/bust/blackjack
4. dealer plays by revealing second card, then hitting one at a time until >=17 or bust
5. split pairs, players cards are divided and played individually, 1x payout for blackjack
6. doubling down when first two cards equal 9 10 or 11, one more card is dealt face down and settled at end of round
7.
